# Analysis for the NYC CitiBike Dashboard

### General Notes on this project 

* The Data I used has been pulled from the month of February from the years 2018, 2019 and 2020.
* The story contains two dashboards to highlight two key phenomena I noticed whilst cleaning the data. 
* I focused on gender as well as start and end station phenomena. 
* Depspite focusing on gender, I did not remove the "unknown" gender from this dataset, not only does it form 48.79% of the customer data but it also tells me that repeated users (subscribers), are far more likely to input their gender information. Additionally, it is out of respect to the fact that not everyone will label themselves as "male" or "female". 
* The earliest year of birth for the riders was 1885, I would think it is fair to say from 1885 to approximately 1930 is just people inputting their DOB wrong. I have trouble believing that someone who is 138 years old is going on bike rides around New York City (but you never know). For this reason I have included a Year or Birth filter in slider format into my dashboard, so as not to discount the potential immortals living amongst us. 
* I have included hyperlinks into the dashboard that link to the original data source. 
* I chose the month Feburary from 3 different years pre-covid to determine if year on year there was an increase in usage.  


### Analysis on the Gender Divide 

* The first phenomena i noticed was the difference between male and female users. 3/4 of all users from the given time frames identified as males, after looking into this phenomena I believe that the large difference is caused by women's increased concerns upon cycling in high traffic areas. Click [here](https://wagner.nyu.edu/rudincenter/2014/05/citi-bike-and-gender) for more information on this. 
* Males form 75.89% of all subscribers of the CitiBike program, with females only forming 22.31%. However, 15.01% of the programs customers are female, whilst 36.2% are male, this leads me to beleive that the unknown 48.79% are predominantly male riders. From this I pull the logical conclusion that male customers are less likely to input their gender information. 

### Analysis on the Popularity of Stations 
* I noticed whilst creating my maps that the popularity of a few stations remained consistent for both the start and end stations, with few changes. 
* The most popular station to start or end a journey by far is Pershing Square North, which is located a stone's throw away from Grand Central Station. Due to the incredibly high foot traffic of commuters in this area, this makes complete sense. 
* W 21st St & 6th Avenue appears to be an area densely populated with restaurants and shops, meaning it will be an indredibly high foot traffic location. 
* W 31st St & 8th Ave is right next to Madison Square Gardens, once again a high foot traffic area. 
* The most popular hours for travel are 5pm and 8am, with the adjacent time slots also quite popular. Leading me to believe that the majority of citibike users will use the program to commute to and from their work places. This is consistent from Febuary 2018, Febuary 2019 and Feburary 2020. 
* The most popular days do not seem to have any distinct pattern. 

## Has there been an Increase of users from 2018 to 2020?
* In Febuary 2018 a total of 843114 people used the program. 
* In Febuary 2019 a total of 943774 people used the program. An 11.94% increase.
* In Febuary 2020 a total of 1146830 people used the program. A 21.52 increase. 
* Meaning that from Feburary 2018 to Febuary 2020 the CitiBike program experienced a 36.02% percent increase in users.
