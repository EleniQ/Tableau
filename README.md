This repo contains the python file I used to clean and manipulate data to create a dashboard.

Click [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) to find the base data I used to create the dashboard. 

Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/helen.vlachou/viz/NYCCitiBike_16740928384510/Story1?publish=yes) to see the tableau dashboard.

I have included analysis of the data as a markdown file, which can be found in the "Analysis" folder.
